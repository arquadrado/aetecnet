<p><strong>MARIA JOSÉ DE FREITAS, ARCHITECT</strong></p>
				<p>When Maria first arrived in Macau 20 years ago, she was called upon to preserve some of Macau’s most important historical sites. Her very first project was helping to restore the Dom Pedro V Theatre which has received UNESCO World Heritage status.</p>
				<p>“The theatre was my first big challenge. Struck by the beauty of the building, right from the start my idea was of taking advantage of such a beauty. I realised that it was absolutely indispensable to achieve an end-result that would enable people to understand and interact with the building’s history.”</p>
				<p>The theatre first opened in 1860 on the orders of Portuguese King Dom Pedro V. Upon completion, it became the focal point for Portuguese celebrations and ceremonies. It has oft en served as a venue for concerts, operas and film screenings.</p>
				<p>“By removing the false ceilings and uncovering some layers of the old structure it was possible to regain the building’s old charm. We have kept the language and the soul of the building as it once was, with modern technology hidden in the background.”</p>
				<p>Stepping inside, you can imagine what the theatre was like in its heyday. This was the centre of Portuguese and Macanese culture in the 19Thand early 20Thcenturies. The Crazy Paris Show girls (who now perform at the Grand Lisboa) danced here for seven years. Today, pianists and theatre groups still come to perform in an intimate setting.</p>	
				<p>Maria recommends that visitors take the time to explore the area in and around the Dom Pedro V theatre – the UNESCO heritage trail, where you will find dozens of ancient temples, churches and other architectural monuments to Macau’s history.</p>
				<p>“I think people should take the time to explore the Leal Senado Square and its surroundings. It is a wonderful open area, where the old and the new generations meet. Still being the heart of the city, it is with out hesitation a must-see.”</p>
